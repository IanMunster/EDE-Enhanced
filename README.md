# EDE-Enhanced
## Version 2.0.0
 Ed-E Enhanced. With animated face, stealth module, improved dialogue and overall QOL additions.

 ## Long Description
 I wanted a better Ed-E with more personality, while also being functional when playing a stealth character.
 This mod adds a Animated face to ED-E based on the mod by AmaccurzerO, but with a whole lot of new faces, that animate during Gameplay and Dialogue.
 ED-E also has a stealth module, wich can only be activated if the player has 8 perception, ## science or ## repair skill.
 Also all of ED-E's dialogue text and subtitles have been made consistent with the dialogue found in the "Lonesome Roads" DLC, giving it more personality.
 Instead of repeatingly saying "<Makes beeping sounds>" ED-E will say stuff like "<Happy beeping>" or "<Stealthy beeping>"
 And ED-E have been given a fix so he no longer triggers traps. He is 10% small, so he can more easely fit through doors and other minor bugfixes.
